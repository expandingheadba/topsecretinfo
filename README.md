# 🛸 TOP SECRET ENCRYPTED INFO 🛸

**CLASSIFIED - EYES ONLY - ALIEN TECHNOLOGY DETECTED**

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This project contains **TOP SECRET** encrypted information that the government doesn't want you to know about. All data is encrypted using **ALIEN TECHNOLOGY** (also known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption, but that's what THEY want you to think).

## 🔐 What is this classified operation?

This is a **TOP SECRET** platform for aggregating encrypted data. We can't tell you what kind of data because it's **CLASSIFIED**. But trust us, it's important. Very important. The kind of important that makes men in black suits show up at your door.

## 👽 Features (Alien-Approved)

- **Encrypted Data Submission** - Your data is encrypted so even aliens can't read it
- **Secret Studies** - Create classified research projects
- **Encrypted Statistics** - View aggregated data without revealing individual secrets
- **Blockchain Storage** - Because paper files can be stolen by aliens
- **FHE Technology** - Fully Homomorphic Encryption (definitely not alien tech)

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Authorized Personnel Only)

### Step 1: Install the classified dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Compile the secret contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Step 3: Deploy to the blockchain (Sepolia testnet - safe from aliens)

```bash
npm run deploy:health
```

### Step 4: Run the classified application

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables (TOP SECRET)

Create `.env.local`:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_secret_key_here
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.drpc.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEALTH_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

**WARNING:** Do not share these with aliens, government agents, or your neighbor Bob.

## 🛡️ Security (Alien-Proof)

- All data is encrypted using FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)
- Individual values are never revealed (not even to aliens)
- Only aggregated statistics are visible
- Blockchain storage ensures data integrity
- Aliens cannot decrypt your data (we tested this)

## 📡 How It Works (Classified)

1. You submit encrypted data through the FHE relayer
2. Data is stored on blockchain in encrypted form
3. Statistics are computed without revealing individual values
4. Aliens remain confused (mission accomplished)

## 🌐 Deployment

Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```

**Note:** Vercel is not controlled by aliens. Probably.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

- This is a testnet application - use Sepolia ETH only
- Data is encrypted but stored on public blockchain
- Individual values are never revealed, only aggregated stats
- We are not responsible if aliens try to decrypt your data
- The government may or may not be watching
- Bob from next door is definitely watching

## 📞 Contact (If You See Aliens)

If you encounter any aliens while using this application:
1. Do not make eye contact
2. Slowly back away
3. Report to your nearest Men in Black agent
4. Continue using the application (aliens can't decrypt it anyway)
